# Backend NestJS with Drizzle ORM and Neon PostgreSQL

This project is a backend infrastructure built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications. It utilizes [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), a TypeScript ORM that offers a lightweight and intuitive way to interact with databases, and connects to a [Neon](https://neon.tech/) serverless PostgreSQL database.

## Key Technologies

*   **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
*   **ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
*   **Database**: [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (Serverless PostgreSQL)
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard NestJS project structure, with the addition of a `drizzle` directory for database-related files.

- `src`: Contains the application source code.
  - `drizzle`: Drizzle ORM module and schema definitions.
- `test`: End-to-end tests.
- `drizzle.config.ts`: Drizzle ORM configuration.
